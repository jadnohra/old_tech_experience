# Interview BMW


## My Chosen Approach for the Interview

Two options

1. Traditional technical interview preparation
2. What gives the best picture of my profile
    * Story with Lyft and William

I decided to take option 2, because
1. This time, I have very little time to prepare
2. Too ambitious work at AID, toughest timelines I ever hard -> take my work home
    * A bit of CS problem solving prep: https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Jad%20Nohra/practice/
    * Big O 
        * Versus notes on asymptotic notation in GK
        * Database of integer sequences (know from 'The Cauchy-Schwarz Masterclass')
3. There are way too many topics that would need de-rusting
        * example: smart pointers were a topic: https://gitlab.com/jadnohra/jad-pre-2015-dabblings/blob/master/Labs/Bigeye/src/BE/smart_ptr.h
4. Option 2 worked at AID, partially due to the offline tech task
    1. Fits my 'French system' historical way of working
    2. But I am now working on improving this
        * Take chances at work for live deep thinking & collaboration
    3. AID offline tech task (this is OK because it has been leaked, and we are changing it)
        * https://gitlab.com/jadnohra/test_AID
        * TODO: notes, and other preps

Note: Option 1 works great with profiles and personalities such as Jacobo

__I take the responsibility upon myself to spend interview time taking my approach__. In the worst case it will be deemed a no-pass, but that's life.


## Problem Solving Approach

1. I have too many topics that I care about
2. In the past, I had the luxury to focus one at a time, since some year, I cannot afford this anymore
3. Stack keeps growing bigger
4. Tried many techniques to mitigate this
    1. Physical notebooks
        * Show GK notes and paper
            1. https://gitlab.com/jadnohra/project_gk/blob/master/simp-hing-analyt/simp-hing-analyt.pdf
                * https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.08221.pdf
            2. https://gitlab.com/jadnohra/project_gk/blob/master/Code/hinge_nlsq_simul.py
            3. https://gitlab.com/jadnohra/project_gk/blob/master/Code/plot_tool.py
            4. https://gitlab.com/jadnohra/project_gk/blob/master/Code/plot_tool_repo.txt
            5. Terminal: 
                 ```python hinges_py2.py -scene chain -help -fancy -wobble_body -fwd_euler -control```
        * Show MLCP
            1. Preliminary: https://www.dropbox.com/preview/LibraryLive/TheNotes/Notes%20on%20the%20Linear%20Complementarity%20Problem.pdf?role=personal
            2. Show Notebook
            3. Show Videos
                * Titan Arm: https://www.dropbox.com/home/Business/HifiSolver?preview=arm.mp4
                * Digger: https://www.dropbox.com/home/Business/HifiSolver?preview=digger.mp4
            4. Cannot show code
    2. Large single-topic latex documents
        1. show PL/QL
    3. Currently: combination of physical notes, latex summaries, and gitlab project management
        1. Show 'Logic Qs' on gitlab
