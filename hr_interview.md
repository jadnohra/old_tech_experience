##### 1. Can you tell me a little about yourself?

This question seems simple, so many people fail to prepare for it, but it's crucial. Here's the deal: Don't give your complete employment (or personal) history. Instead give a pitch—one that’s concise and compelling and that shows exactly why you’re the right fit for the job. Start off with the 2-3 specific accomplishments or experiences that you most want the interviewer to know about, then wrap up talking about how that prior experience has positioned you for this specific role.

Read More



##### 2. How did you hear about the position?

Another seemingly innocuous interview question, this is actually a perfect opportunity to stand out and show your passion for and connection to the company. For example, if you found out about the gig through a friend or professional contact, name drop that person, then share why you were so excited about it. If you discovered the company through an event or article, share that. Even if you found the listing through a random job board, share what, specifically, caught your eye about the role.

Read More



##### 3. What do you know about the company?

Any candidate can read and regurgitate the company’s “About” page. So, when interviewers ask this, they aren't necessarily trying to gauge whether you understand the mission—they want to know whether you care about it. Start with one line that shows you understand the company's goals, using a couple key words and phrases from the website, but then go on to make it personal. Say, “I’m personally drawn to this mission because…” or “I really believe in this approach because…” and share a personal example or two.

Read More



##### 4. Why do you want this job?

Again, companies want to hire people who are passionate about the job, so you should have a great answer about why you want the position. (And if you don't? You probably should apply elsewhere.) First, identify a couple of key factors that make the role a great fit for you (e.g., “I love customer support because I love the constant human interaction and the satisfaction that comes from helping someone solve a problem"), then share why you love the company (e.g., “I’ve always been passionate about education, and I think you guys are doing great things, so I want to be a part of it”).

Read More



##### 5. Why should we hire you?

This interview question seems forward (not to mention intimidating!), but if you're asked it, you're in luck: There's no better setup for you to sell yourself and your skills to the hiring manager. Your job here is to craft an answer that covers three things: that you can not only do the work, you can deliver great results; that you'll really fit in with the team and culture; and that you'd be a better hire than any of the other candidates.

Read More





##### 6. What are your greatest professional strengths?

When answering this question, interview coach Pamela Skillings recommends being accurate (share your true strengths, not those you think the interviewer wants to hear); relevant (choose your strengths that are most targeted to this particular position); and specific (for example, instead of “people skills,” choose “persuasive communication” or “relationship building”). Then, follow up with an example of how you've demonstrated these traits in a professional setting.

Read More



##### 7. What do you consider to be your weaknesses?

What your interviewer is really trying to do with this question—beyond identifying any major red flags—is to gauge your self-awareness and honesty. So, “I can't meet a deadline to save my life” is not an option—but neither is “Nothing! I'm perfect!” Strike a balance by thinking of something that you struggle with but that you’re working to improve. For example, maybe you’ve never been strong at public speaking, but you've recently volunteered to run meetings to help you be more comfortable when addressing a crowd.

Read More



##### 8. What is your greatest professional achievement?

Nothing says “hire me” better than a track record of achieving amazing results in past jobs, so don't be shy when answering this interview question! A great way to do so is by using the S-T-A-R method: Set up the situation and the task that you were required to complete to provide the interviewer with background context (e.g., “In my last job as a junior analyst, it was my role to manage the invoicing process”), but spend the bulk of your time describing what you actually did (the action) and what you achieved (the result). For example, “In one month, I streamlined the process, which saved my group 10 man-hours each month and reduced errors on invoices by 25%.”

Read More



##### 9. Tell me about a challenge or conflict you've faced at work, and how you dealt with it.

In asking this behavioral interview question, “your interviewer wants to get a sense of how you will respond to conflict. Anyone can seem nice and pleasant in a job interview, but what will happen if you’re hired and Gladys in Compliance starts getting in your face?” says Skillings. Again, you'll want to use the S-T-A-R method, being sure to focus on how you handled the situation professionally and productively, and ideally closing with a happy ending, like how you came to a resolution or compromise.

Read More



##### 10. Where do you see yourself in five years?

If asked this question, be honest and specific about your future goals, but consider this: A hiring manager wants to know a) if you've set realistic expectations for your career, b) if you have ambition (a.k.a., this interview isn't the first time you're considering the question), and c) if the position aligns with your goals and growth. Your best bet is to think realistically about where this position could take you and answer along those lines. And if the position isn’t necessarily a one-way ticket to your aspirations? It’s OK to say that you’re not quite sure what the future holds, but that you see this experience playing an important role in helping you make that decision.

Read More



##### 11. What's your dream job?

Along similar lines, the interviewer wants to uncover whether this position is really in line with your ultimate career goals. While “an NBA star” might get you a few laughs, a better bet is to talk about your goals and ambitions—and why this job will get you closer to them.

Read More



##### 12. What other companies are you interviewing with?

Companies ask this for a number of reasons, from wanting to see what the competition is for you to sniffing out whether you're serious about the industry. “Often the best approach is to mention that you are exploring a number of other similar options in the company's industry,” says job search expert Alison Doyle. “It can be helpful to mention that a common characteristic of all the jobs you are applying to is the opportunity to apply some critical abilities and skills that you possess. For example, you might say 'I am applying for several positions with IT consulting firms where I can analyze client needs and translate them to development teams in order to find solutions to technology problems.'”

Read More



##### 13. Why are you leaving your current job?

This is a toughie, but one you can be sure you'll be asked. Definitely keep things positive—you have nothing to gain by being negative about your past employers. Instead, frame things in a way that shows that you're eager to take on new opportunities and that the role you’re interviewing for is a better fit for you than your current or last position. For example, “I’d really love to be part of product development from beginning to end, and I know I’d have that opportunity here.” And if you were let go? Keep it simple: “Unfortunately, I was let go,” is a totally OK answer.

Read More



##### 14. Why were you fired?

OK, if you get the admittedly much tougher follow-up question as to why you were let go (and the truth isn't exactly pretty), your best bet is to be honest (the job-seeking world is small, after all). But it doesn't have to be a deal-breaker. Share how you’ve grown and how you approach your job and life now as a result. If you can position the learning experience as an advantage for this next job, even better.

Read More



##### 15. What are you looking for in a new position?

Hint: Ideally the same things that this position has to offer. Be specific.

Read More



##### 16. What type of work environment do you prefer?

Hint: Ideally one that's similar to the environment of the company you're applying to. Be specific.

Read More



##### 17. What's your management style?

The best managers are strong but flexible, and that's exactly what you want to show off in your answer. (Think something like, “While every situation and every team member requires a bit of a different strategy, I tend to approach my employee relationships as a coach...”) Then, share a couple of your best managerial moments, like when you grew your team from five to 15 or coached an underperforming employee to become the company's top salesperson.

Read More



##### 18. What's a time you exercised leadership?

Depending on what's more important for the the role, you'll want to choose an example that showcases your project management skills (spearheading a project from end to end, juggling multiple moving parts) or one that shows your ability to confidently and effectively rally a team. And remember: “The best stories include enough detail to be believable and memorable,” says Skillings. “Show how you were a leader in this situation and how it represents your overall leadership experience and potential.”

Read More



##### 19. What's a time you disagreed with a decision that was made at work?

Everyone disagrees with the boss from time to time, but in asking this interview question, hiring managers want to know that you can do so in a productive, professional way. “You don’t want to tell the story about the time when you disagreed but your boss was being a jerk and you just gave in to keep the peace. And you don’t want to tell the one where you realized you were wrong,” says Peggy McKee of Career Confidential. “Tell the one where your actions made a positive difference on the outcome of the situation, whether it was a work-related outcome or a more effective and productive working relationship.”

Read More



##### 20. How would your boss and co-workers describe you?

First of all, be honest (remember, if you get this job, the hiring manager will be calling your former bosses and co-workers!). Then, try to pull out strengths and traits you haven't discussed in other aspects of the interview, such as your strong work ethic or your willingness to pitch in on other projects when needed.

Read More



##### 21. Why was there a gap in your employment?

If you were unemployed for a period of time, be direct and to the point about what you’ve been up to (and hopefully, that’s a litany of impressive volunteer and other mind-enriching activities, like blogging or taking classes). Then, steer the conversation toward how you will do the job and contribute to the organization: “I decided to take a break at the time, but today I’m ready to contribute to this organization in the following ways.”

Read More



##### 22. Can you explain why you changed career paths?

Don't be thrown off by this question—just take a deep breath and explain to the hiring manager why you've made the career decisions you have. More importantly, give a few examples of how your past experience is transferrable to the new role. This doesn't have to be a direct connection; in fact, it's often more impressive when a candidate can make seemingly irrelevant experience seem very relevant to the role.

Read More



##### 23. How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?

"Choose an answer that shows that you can meet a stressful situation head-on in a productive, positive manner and let nothing stop you from accomplishing your goals," says McKee. A great approach is to talk through your go-to stress-reduction tactics (making the world's greatest to-do list, stopping to take 10 deep breaths), and then share an example of a stressful situation you navigated with ease.

Read More



##### 24. What would your first 30, 60, or 90 days look like in this role?

Start by explaining what you'd need to do to get ramped up. What information would you need? What parts of the company would you need to familiarize yourself with? What other employees would you want to sit down with? Next, choose a couple of areas where you think you can make meaningful contributions right away. (e.g., “I think a great starter project would be diving into your email marketing campaigns and setting up a tracking system for them.”) Sure, if you get the job, you (or your new employer) might decide there’s a better starting place, but having an answer prepared will show the interviewer where you can add immediate impact—and that you’re excited to get started.

Read More



##### 25. What are your salary requirements?

The #1 rule of answering this question is doing your research on what you should be paid by using sites like Payscale and Glassdoor. You’ll likely come up with a range, and we recommend stating the highest number in that range that applies, based on your experience, education, and skills. Then, make sure the hiring manager knows that you're flexible. You're communicating that you know your skills are valuable, but that you want the job and are willing to negotiate.

Read More



##### 26. What do you like to do outside of work?

Interviewers ask personal questions in an interview to “see if candidates will fit in with the culture [and] give them the opportunity to open up and display their personality, too,” says longtime hiring manager Mitch Fortner. “In other words, if someone asks about your hobbies outside of work, it’s totally OK to open up and share what really makes you tick. (Do keep it semi-professional, though: Saying you like to have a few beers at the local hot spot on Saturday night is fine. Telling them that Monday is usually a rough day for you because you’re always hungover is not.)”

Read More



##### 27. If you were an animal, which one would you want to be?

Seemingly random personality-test type questions like these come up in interviews generally because hiring managers want to see how you can think on your feet. There's no wrong answer here, but you'll immediately gain bonus points if your answer helps you share your strengths or personality or connect with the hiring manager. Pro tip: Come up with a stalling tactic to buy yourself some thinking time, such as saying, “Now, that is a great question. I think I would have to say… ”

Read More



##### 28. How many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine?

1,000? 10,000? 100,000? Seriously?

Well, seriously, you might get asked brainteaser questions like these, especially in quantitative jobs. But remember that the interviewer doesn’t necessarily want an exact number—he wants to make sure that you understand what’s being asked of you, and that you can set into motion a systematic and logical way to respond. So, just take a deep breath, and start thinking through the math. (Yes, it’s OK to ask for a pen and paper!)

Read More



##### 29. Are you planning on having children?

Questions about your family status, gender (“How would you handle managing a team of all men?”), nationality (“Where were you born?”), religion, or age, are illegal—but they still get asked (and frequently). Of course, not always with ill intent—the interviewer might just be trying to make conversation—but you should definitely tie any questions about your personal life (or anything else you think might be inappropriate) back to the job at hand. For this question, think: “You know, I’m not quite there yet. But I am very interested in the career paths at your company. Can you tell me more about that?”

Read More



##### 30. What do you think we could do better or differently?

This is a common one at startups (and one of our personal favorites here at The Muse). Hiring managers want to know that you not only have some background on the company, but that you're able to think critically about it and come to the table with new ideas. So, come with new ideas! What new features would you love to see? How could the company increase conversions? How could customer service be improved? You don’t need to have the company’s four-year strategy figured out, but do share your thoughts, and more importantly, show how your interests and expertise would lend themselves to the job.

Read More



##### 31. Do you have any questions for us?

You probably already know that an interview isn't just a chance for a hiring manager to grill you—it's your opportunity to sniff out whether a job is the right fit for you. What do you want to know about the position? The company? The department? The team?

You'll cover a lot of this in the actual interview, so have a few less-common questions ready to go. We especially like questions targeted to the interviewer (“What's your favorite part about working here?") or the company's growth (“What can you tell me about your new products or plans for growth?")

##### Tell me something about yourself in brief

This is one of the most frequently asked questions during an HR round interview. Your answer has to be short, crisp and to the point. Here are some possible high-impact answers to help you leave a great impression.

Here are some possible high-impact answers to help you leave a great impression.

Possible Answer #1:

“Thank you, Sir/Ma’am for this opportunity. I am from XYZ City and belong to a nuclear family. My father is a Central Government Employee and my mother is a Vice Principal at a private school. My younger sister will appear her CBSE 10th board this year. We are a very close-knit family. On an individual front, I perceive myself as a confident, conscientious and hardworking individual. I carry out any task assigned to me without hesitation, provided the instructions are clear. In the case of doubts, I never hesitate to put forth my questions. I have always been a fast learner, and I love to keep up my process of learning to figure out better ways of solving problems. Moreover, I love to compete with my own past performances than competing with my peers, as I believe that improvement is always better than perfection!”
Don’t make the mistake of sharing too much personal information in any of your HR interview questions and answers round. You will not be left with enough time to sell your experience and relevant technical skills.

Possible Answer #2:

“Well, I am a confident, hardworking and a very professional individual. I have always carried out all the tasks assigned to me without hesitation, provided the instructions from my Reporting Managers or seniors were clear. I have also been a good mentor to my juniors and never hesitate to guide them. On the other hand, I am a creative person and I love to test my boundaries. In order to do so, I keep pushing myself to think out of the box!”
This is another version of frequently asked HR Interview questions and answers, for the same question.

Possible Answer #3:

“I’m a management consultant with 12 years’ of experience that I have gained across multiple industries and sectors such as financial services, IT, Telecom, retail, and media. In my current job role, I am responsible for business development activities. In the last financial year alone, I sold projects totaling INR 40,00,000 to clients. On a daily basis, I handle a 10-member strong team of consultants and junior consultants. Besides being a management consultant, I am a fair and independent individual. I try not to be judgmental and always absorb constructive criticism, listen to my boss' inputs, my client's complaints as well as address my team members' issues, to my best possible abilities.”

##### Describe who you are. or Tell me about your background.

In an HR round, you will surely face this question among all other HR interview questions and answers asked to you, and I am sure you treat it as the easiest of all questions. Well, it’s not! Never underestimate the possibility of scoring better points with a crisp answer, if you feel confident. It can become a fate-changer for applicants having fewer than 5 years of total job experience.

If your degree is obviously related to the job you’re interviewing for, you can give this answer.

Possible Answer #1:

“I am a B. Tech in Computer Science/B. Com in Economics. I also have an MBA or I have completed a certification course in Digital Marketing from ABC Academy. What else would you like to know?”
In case your degree is not as relevant as it should have been, but you feel that you have the potential to shine through, you can give this answer. This is a useful tip for HR interview questions and answers.

Possible Answer #2:

“I have worked on an independent project work with 2 other students on Soft Skills. I have also participated in several paper presentations on Business Communication.”
Do not forget to talk about your major subject in your UG/PG at the University and also about subjects/papers, that are relevant to the job, that you have applied for.

Possible Answer #3:

“I have scored an A in Professional and Technical Written Communication in English, in my first semester. Here’s my marksheet.”
Here you will expect a new HR interview question, and the answer to this one will be more relevant to your education. In case there is an odd pause, start talking about cocurricular activities that you are good at. For example, you can say this.

Possible Answer #4:

“I am a music enthusiast and a beginner level guitarist. I love to jam with my 4-member band every weekend at my place.”
Such an answer will add a light mood to the interview and make things more positive. Professionals can also cite the above answer and highlight certain awards and accolades which they have earned during their school/college or university years.

Possible Answer #5:

“I was a good orator and always stood first in debate and elocution competitions during my school and college days.”
Read more answers here.

##### What are your strengths and weaknesses?

This is a very common question asked by HR personnel to candidates. Remember that interviewers these days hardly ever get impressed by flowery responses. So be careful while tackling this one.

Possible Answer #1:

“I have several strengths namely – I am patient, committed, honest and self-motivated. I am the biggest dreamer I have ever come across! I forgive easily and hate to keep grudges in my heart. My greatest weakness is that I don't like getting interrupted when I am seriously into something. Another one of my weaknesses is that I trust people very easily. As I already said, I am a very patient person, so I am actively working on this lacuna.”
Possible Answer #2:

“I am impatient which is the reason why I am a quick learner. But I honestly believe that being impatient is a real weakness. I expect my team members to prove themselves and start delivering on the very first assignment. In case a particular resource fails, I have a tendency to stop delegating work to them and pick up projects on my own. I am working on this attitude and in my previous organizations, my peers helped me cope up with this to a great extent. To compensate for my own weakness, I prep my people about my exact expectations. Then I give them a complete scope of the assignment followed by various “checkpoint” dates, where they can update me about their progress, with a demo/presentation if applicable. In my previous job as a Project Manager, I was handling a 15-member team of both individual contributors and Business Managers like Lawyers, Web Designers, Graphic Designers, SEO/SEM Consultants, Editors, Writers and Callers. I used to break the entire task down into manageable chunks for each employee, followed by stringent timelines about when they would circle back to me. This process worked brilliantly, helped me stay within the assigned budget and helped everyone achieve their individual targets, as they learnt.”
Tip: In your HR interview questions and answers round, avoid confusing answers such as this one. It might spark a war of words. Instead of this, you need to highlight a skill-set which you feel has scope for improvement. Remember to summarize what you have been doing to improve the same. The takeaway here is that your HR round interviewer is not interested to know about your weakness. Rather s/he is interested to see how well you handle the situation!

Possible Answer #3:

“I am a perfectionist and that is my main weakness, which I also think is my strength.”

##### You have not done your PG yet. This is not a drawback, but don’t you think you should get a PG degree asap?

Other variations of this question are as follows:

Do you want to complete your Masters/Post Graduation in near future?
Do you aspire to pursue higher studies?
Don’t fall into the interviewer’s trap. This question is shot at you to check your confidence level. So, do not feel unarmed or look surprised. Keep your calm and answer smartly with a strong and indestructible logic.

Possible Answer #1:

“As soon as I graduated, I felt the urge to start working in the real world. It’s not that I am a total novice. I have undergone 3 internships, of which 2 are paid from reputed organizations. This credential has helped me land an offer from one of those firms. I sometimes wonder whether I should have first completed my post-graduation. Had I done so, I wouldn’t have been able to develop my complete portfolio. And I am hoping that my track record will help me get selected for this position in your esteemed organization.”
Possible Answer #2:

“Having a PG degree is important, but I don’t think it is mandatory. Most job seekers out there have similar degrees. In order to differentiate, a PG degree from a reputed university along with the total experience can obviously help me stand out. I am aware of this and as soon as I get a call from any university about an executive program with weekend classes, I will surely enroll for the same. As of now, I have a lot of responsibilities back home, which is why I don’t think it will be wise on my part to enroll myself into a full-time PG program.”

##### You have changed jobs/jumped ship too many times already, why so?

This question is asked exclusively to experienced professionals who have switched jobs more than two times in their entire career. Freshers can skip to the next question.

Possible Answer #1:

“You may label me a ‘frequent career-changer’ but I genuinely feel that today I am a far better employee. My switches have helped me develop better interpersonal skills, gain diverse skills and adapt to rapidly changing business environments. I can solve problems more efficiently and creatively, as I have learned to live with ambiguity and uncertainty. My first job helped me develop patience. My second job helped me master spreadsheets and numbers. My third job helped me develop better people skills and also adjust amidst culturally diverse and geographically dispersed teams. All in all, I feel that my varied background makes me an ideal candidate for this job role today.”
Possible Answer #2:

“I never expected to work with so many companies in these few years. The companies that I worked for were small and one of them was going through a really bad patch. But honestly, my journey has been a rewarding one. I can now confidently walk into a new situation and successfully figure out ways to make a difference. This was truly meant to happen and I wouldn’t exchange all the experience I’ve gained from my switches, for anything! But I am seriously looking forward to not having to do this, any more in the near future. I want to make a stint that lasts for 5 to 10 years with a reputed organization, such as yours. This will make my career a stable and a fruitful one in the long run.”

##### What are your strong points? or What are your strengths?

Don’t just talk about your strengths, your interviewer genuinely wants to know about your strong points.

Possible Answer #1:

“I am passionate towards my work and also a good listener, which means, I take my instructions seriously. I am not a person who leaves things midway. I never lose focus, even if I am under stress or have stringent deadlines to meet. I like to finish every single task on my to-do list completely. Optimism, energy and my ability to learn quickly let me hit the ground and rapidly solve problems. I also have good communication skills which means I can deal fairly well with my business clients as well as with the members of my internal team, in the future. Based on my skills, abilities, and experience, I know I would be a great addition to the team.”
Possible Answer #2:

“I have the requisite skills to make your risk worth it. Chatting less and letting my work do the talking, is my motto. In the past, whatever project was assigned to me was delivered on time and also at par with all the quality standards.”
Possible Answer #3:

“I’ve been told that I’m a very good manager. My team tells me that I give them a lot of freedom in how to do their work, which they really appreciate. They also say that I’m really enthusiastic, so when we’re faced with too much work, they tell me that my manner really helps to keep them motivated and calm. My boss also tells me that I’m very innovative in terms of finding new ways of working that cut out inefficiency.”

##### What are your strong points? or What are your strengths?

What is your greatest fear?

Remember that this is a stress test question.

Don’t simply talk about your weaknesses, your interviewer genuinely wants you to talk about your loopholes! Try to resist the urge to give him/her more points to reject you. Answer diplomatically.

Possible Answer #1:

“You might think that since I have never worked in my life, and this is only my first job, my inexperience is my weakness. But I beg to differ. I am a fast learner and very open minded. I assure that I do not carry any pre-conceived notions regarding how I feel I should perform my job.”
Possible Answer #2:

“I work too hard sometimes and care too much about my work. I take my tasks back home and work even during the weekends. You can call me a workaholic, but my family always points out that this is not right. Slowly and steadily I am realizing that speed and working smartly are the key. So, I have begun to reach out to my colleagues for ready-to-use workarounds so that I can give more time to my family.”

##### If I call up your current or previous reporting manager now, what will be their opinion about you? What will they say that you need to work on?

Freshers with no internship experience can move on to the next question to prepare for HR interview questions and answers.

Possible Answer #1:

“I used to get nervous while speaking in front of large groups. You can say that I had stage-fear, and I believe that I still do. This is partly because I am shy by nature. No wonder that I have been always assigned Individual Contributor roles. My current manager might cite this as one of my weaknesses, and he has actually helped me to overcome my shyness. Thanks to him, today I am an active member of Toastmasters International and my journey with them has been great so far! I am working to improve my public speaking, and leadership skills and I am sure my future employer will witness a blatant change in me.”
Possible Answer #2:

“Interesting. During my last performance review, my boss did not list any areas of improvement and gave me an outstanding rating. However, if I were to think of one, I would guess that I need to speak up more during meetings. I always have good ideas and contribute my thoughts to my current project. But I discuss these ideas with my boss and let him do all the talking during meetings. I should work on speaking up more during brainstorming sessions.”

##### Do you have any serious medical issues?

Note: Please make sure that you talk about relevant health conditions, wherever needed while having a discussion during your HR interview questions and answers round. A “serious health condition” generally includes pregnancy or any chronic disease such as epilepsy and cancer.

If you do not have any of the above, do not give out too many details about your illness. For example, if you are suffering from cold flu, say so. Do not exaggerate the situation as it might create a negative impression wherein your HR will start to anticipate your absence in the near future. If you do so, you might bid goodbye to goodies such as travel opportunities, promotions, hikes and even ripe leadership positions.

It is permissible for your future employer to question you. Some might ask you to get a complete medical check-up done and submit the report during joining. While giving out the answer, be brief and summarize the health condition in a few short sentences.

Possible Answer #1:

“I am partially color blind. Sometimes I face difficulty in distinguishing between colors. For example, I cannot see shades or tones of the same color. But for your information, no adjustments would be required on your part to accommodate this minor disability. As you can see from my resume, it does not have any impact on my ability to get the job done.”
Possible Answer #2:

“I do not have severe health issues, but I do have a migraine issue. I have never disclosed my condition on a job interview before or on a pre-employment health questionnaire, as I was afraid that it might jeopardize my career. But I am undergoing both acute (abortive) and preventive (prophylactic) therapies and most of my colleagues know about it. The situation is completely under control and I have been almost cured.”
Possible Answer #3:

“I do not have any serious medical issues.”

##### Did you ever have a conflict with your current/previous boss or professor?

Possible Answer #1:

“Recently I had a disagreement with one of my professors about a question that was out of syllabus in one of the semester exams. It was not a major one, but yes I will label it a ‘conflict’. Most of my friends and peers did not attempt this question due to ambiguity. When I brought the cause into my professor’s notice in private, he remained cold and unconcerned. So, I and my batchmates had a discussion following which, we went to him together. At that point, our professor agreed that the question was ambiguous, but he refused to give us grace marks for the same. I felt disappointed because he did not appreciate the fact that I brought the situation earlier, into his notice in private. Besides, he did not suggest an alternative paper or project work, with which students could make up for the lost marks.”
Possible Answer #2:

“I was managing the creation of our new company presentation, flyers, standees, brochure, and emailers. My team had to meet a very tight deadline because everything had to be delivered on time. I was in charge of the deliverables and had to manage all my team members which included Marketing, Sales, Graphic Design, Events and Product Management. My designer was very talented, but he, unfortunately, missed a deadline. When I approached him about the same, he started bad-mouthing me. I was taken aback but explained my reasoning again. Eventually, we decided to speak to our AVP about how important and time-consuming this project was. The AVP agreed and ended up assigning other designing projects to another graphic designer. This took pressure off my team and then we focused on our priority. Later my designer apologized for the blow-up and his behavior. He also thanked me for my help.”

##### What do your friends/co-workers say about you?

Possible Answer #1:

“I recently completed my internship at Tata Steel Ltd., Tata Center, Kolkata. My project lead told me that in the beginning, I was a little lost, but by the end of the summer internship program, she knew that she could count on me.”
Possible Answer #2:

“Since I like to build strong professional relationships with my teammates, most of them have become great friends. We have been spending eight hours a day, five days a week for several years now. So, I am sure that whatever they say, will be realistic and not made up. One thing that they will surely mention about me is my love for food! The rest is up to you to find out.”

##### What did you do in the last year to improve your knowledge?

Possible Answer #1:

“In 2016, I was in the final year of college. During that time, I did three things to improve my knowledge. 1. I got myself enrolled in Aptech for the Sun Certified Java Programmer course. I will appear my exam soon. 2. I have bought magazine subscriptions such as Dataquest. These magazines help me to stay well informed about new topics in the IT world. 3. I completed my final year application project based on Java. The topic was Centralized Remote Based College Information Scheme.”
Possible Answer #2:

“Being an L3 or senior level Windows/Linux Administrator I have mastered my virtualization experience on VMware, KVM, Xen, Hyper-V etc. I made sure to understand storage and networking better last year. I picked up PERL scripting last month and plan to pick up Ruby and Python in the next 3 months. I am also a beginner level programmer as I learnt C++. I mastered Chef on job and have deployed Amazon AWS to understand cloud better. I also earned my Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) license and I am targeting RHCA by the end of 2017.”
Note: Remember, certification is the key to land a job in an IT firm. So, get certified asap in your core skills.

##### Explain the difference between group and team. Are you a team player?

Possible Answer #1:

“Yes I am. During my summer internship at Cadence, me and my friends were working together. Ours was a mixed group with varied skills and we produced results which would have been impossible to produce individually. I had to keep all my communication channels open at all times to ensure that the project stayed on track. I was responsible for my part of the code and also for the collective delivery of the entire project. I worked closely with senior key team members to keep my deliverables on track. In the end, I was able to deliver on time and within budget.”
Possible Answer #2:

“Yes, I am. Though I am currently in an IC (individual contributor) role, I like working with others as personally, I am social and outgoing. I like to nurture and build team spirit. At least once a month we go for team lunch or host team parties and generally, I am in charge of the fiancés from the pool fund. In case there is no budget left in some month, I ensure a potluck lunch. Being a senior in the team, I keep my eyes and ears open to understand the needs of all the others, especially my juniors and freshers. We help each other focus on what really matters, instead of getting bogged down with irrelevant pressure. My strong communication skills help me coordinate between different team members and resolve further issues.”

##### What is your ideal company or workplace?

Possible Answer #1:

“My ideal workplace or company is a fair one that values my contributions even as a fresher and encourages me to speak up and share my ideas. It is a place where I can be myself, while working towards a greater goal.”
Possible Answer #2:

“My ideal company is the one which can bring forth exciting challenges. Such opportunities will bring out the best in me as I can use my interests and experiences to grow. I like my present workplace as it offers all this along with a clean and professional work atmosphere, and more. But I am looking forward to a company that is actively involved in social welfare, and your organization does exactly that.”

##### Have you ever had to fire anyone? How did you feel about that?

This question is not applicable to first-time job seekers who are about to face a round of HR interview questions and answers. You can skip to the next question if you are a fresher. Mostly manager and above level interview candidates are asked this question.

Possible Answer:

“Yes, I have and believe me it feels horrible. But I know how to keep emotions at bay, while I am at work. Firing comes at the very end of road with me. When I set up a team, I do so very carefully after considering the past feedback and history of every single team member. But it is not always possible to choose your team. Sometimes, you have to work with a few rotten potatoes and it is essential to remove them from the basket, to save the rest. I have a tendency to spot poor performers within two to three months of them or me joining a new team. Last time I spotted one, I consulted my peers and other team members. Then, I had to set up a one-on-one meeting with the person and gave him several warnings, both written and verbal, over a 30-day period. I helped him prepare a list of work and behavioral goals, that I decided upon after consulting the rest of the team. Eventually I had to fire that person because he showed zero signs of improvement, drive and motivation. That firing was for a cause and I had no other resort left in my rule book.”

##### What is the most difficult thing that you’ve ever accomplished? or What is the most difficult thing you have ever done?

Possible Answer #1:

“I have never been a great public speaker. The very thought of facing a crowd used to make me nervous. When I started college, my best friend advised me that I had to get over this roadblock to shine through. So, last year, I took the bold step of trying my hand at public speaking. I joined the Debate Club in my college. Since then, I have participated in multiple contests. Initially, I stammered, forgot my lines, dropped the microphone once due to my sweaty palms and even got booed at or scolded by the judges. Yet, I kept on participating. Last month, for the very first time in a year, I won the third prize. It was a great boost to my self-confidence. I believe that it is my greatest feat so far, even bigger than my AIEEE rank.”
Possible Answer #2:

“I have helped my father set up his business from scratch. This is our family business and a startup as well. The initial days were really very tough as I had to learn and apply everything at once. Be it sales, marketing, leadership, management, finance, finance, human resources etc. I became a jack of all trades overnight. It was really difficult to running and grow the business. Nothing was so difficult or stressful as this one, midway I even slipped into depression and anxiety. I even made up my mind to quit my job and focus entirely on my father’s dream, but thankfully the business took of due to our collective efforts and today, I am free to focus on my career once again, and do what I love the most. The accomplishment bit here is that I feel whole and complete, as my family business is running smoothly and my career is undisturbed.”

##### What is the difference between hard work and smart work?

Possible Answer #1:

“Hard work is what every breadwinner does today, including a rickshaw puller or a daily wager. Smart work is what the educated masses like us are supposed to do, and some of us are actually doing it, like my father. A well-balanced combination of both hard work and smart work is the secret formula to success. I have friends who study all through the year and yet have 10 back papers to clear. They do not have any interview calls in their kitty, and what do you think is the reason behind this? It is their lack of understanding about smart work. All year through, they were only working hard, but not smartly. They did not prioritize their goals properly. Again, there’s me, I do not have any back papers and have a decent CGPA. I am also attending this interview today. Whatever might be the outcome, I feel I have prioritized my goals correctly and have worked both hard and smart. That is the difference between hard work and smart work.”
Possible Answer #2:

“Hard work is delivering work on time with more effort and smart work is delivering work on time, with lesser effort. I feel that is the basic difference. Most of the times, in the corporate world, I feel a combination of both is needed to attain excellence.”

##### How do you feel about working weekends and night shifts?

Possible Answer #1:

“I am a fresher and I hardly have any exposure of the corporate world. Back in college, weekends were no different from weekdays for us. The assignments, tasks and projects had to be submitted within deadlines, and to do so, we would study during the weekdays. As far as night shifts are concerned, I would like to say that I am a nocturnal person and I like to do my studies generally at night. I have no issues working during weekends and at night, provided I get enough compensatory offs to relax and wind down.”
Possible Answer #2:

“Sir, my body clock has got tuned into regular weekday shifts from 9 to 6. I am not comfortable working nights and weekends on a regular basis, unless there is some urgent deliverable or a resource crunch in the team, I will surely pitch in. But working odd shifts is not good for the mental and physical health of employees and I hope you understand the same. Yet, if the company needs my presence mandatorily at night or during the weekend for continued growth and success, I will definitely work for it.”

##### Where do you see yourself 3 years from now? or Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Possible Answer #1:

“My current goal is to find a career spot that ensures continued growth alongside new challenges daily. 3 years from now, I see myself as an experienced and reliable senior in the team and 5 years from now, I assume that I will be ready to take up managerial responsibilities like product strategy. I want to have a stable career in a single organization and hope I will get the same wherever I start.”
Possible Answer #2:

“I see myself working for a reputed organization, at a strategic position with budgeting power, good remuneration, and minimal interference.”

##### Give an example of a time you had to respond to an unhappy manager/ customer/ colleague/ professor/ friend.

Possible Answer #1:

“Personally, I am not too fond of conflicts. I don’t like it when people are mean, so I try to avoid conflicts and tongue-lashing as far as possible. In case such a situation arises, I let my seniors or professors handle it. I cannot recollect the exact situation right now, but that’s what I have done in the past.”
Possible Answer #2:

“In my previous job, a client was yelling on the phone. I understand that his reaction was completely out of frustration. So instead of taking it personally, I tried to calm him done, and ensured that his concern was well heard. How did I do it? Well, I listened to him carefully and apologized once he finished. It ended up being a win-win situation for everyone.”

##### How quickly do you adapt to new technology?

Possible Answer #1:

“I can adapt quickly to new circumstances. Since I am clear about my job role and I am mentally prepared to take up challenges, I feel I have the capacity to learn fast and apply my new knowledge. During my student life, I had to clear new papers and projects in every semester and thoroughly enjoyed doing it. Similarly, I will enjoy picking up new technologies in my professional life as well.”
Possible Answer #2:

“Being a Bigdata Engineer working on game analytics engine, which is in itself a completely new field, I have a great track record of adapting to new technologies. I have picked up and implemented restful cloud application which can extract data from MongoDB or Aerospike and processes this data in Spark. The application I built takes SQL query inputs to process and generate output in a JSON, PSV, TDE format Same is published on a tableau server and further uploaded into the AWS S3 buckets. In order to build this API, I mastered Java/Scala Drop wizard, Spark, MongoDB, Aerospike, SQL, Tableau SDK, YAML, Maven, and SBT in just 1 year.

Whatever may be the case, the core requirements of my job role are constant. I AM a Hadoop/Spark Engineer. Yes, it does take me some time to forge positive working relationships with new colleagues, but when it comes to technology, I am always the front runner.”

##### What software packages are you familiar with?

Make sure you know each of your skills thoroughly. In case you don’t know a particular software package or a terminology, please do not talk about it in front of the interviewer. (Keep this important tip in mind while preparing for HR interview questions and answers).

Possible Answer #1:

“I am proficient in Operating Systems like Windows and Linux. I am familiar with Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint from the Microsoft Office Suite. I am also familiar with regular web Browsers, Photoshop and AutoCAD.”
Possible Answer #2:

“Among the Operating Systems, I am proficient in Windows NT, Windows XP, Windows ME, Mac 0SX, Windows 2000, Mac OS 8.6, Solaris, Mac 0S9, UNIX, Linux, AIX, Sun OS, OS/2, DOS, FreeBSD, Novell 4.0, Exchange 5.5, etc.

Among software solutions, I am proficient in Microsoft Office Suite, IE, Outlook Express, Lotus 1-2-3, IBM Notes, etc.

I also have good knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw Pro, Adobe Illustrator, Studio, FileMaker Pro, MySQL, SQL Server, SQL 6.5 & 7.0, Enterprise Manager, EZ-SQL, Net Objects Fusion, Vignette, Broad Vision, etc.

The remaining have been listed in my resume. Please have a look.”

##### On a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate yourself as a leader?

HR interview questions and answers are a way of testing you in and out. The HR interviewer may ask you this question to gauge your self-confidence.

Possible Answer #1:

“I rate my leadership skills an 8 out of 10. There is much to learn, but I have always been a strong leader. I was the head boy/girl during my school days and in the college, I was a Senior Wing NCC Cadet. I have completed my C-certificate and have earned lots of badges in several NCC camps. I have led the Senior Boys/Girls contingent at the Republic Day Camp in 2012 as well.”
Possible Answer #2:

“I am a good leader. That is the reason why today, I manage a 5-member strong team independently in an MNC. While assigning tasks, I consider people skills often. If a team member is feeling demotivated, I try my level best to understand them and accordingly control the situation. Bearing my performance as a Manager over the past few years, I would rate myself an 8.5/10, as there is still a lot of scope to learn and grow.”

##### What makes you angry?

Possible Answer #1:

“I get angry when I get falsely accused of something that I did not do. Lack of order and discipline also irritates me, but 4 years of hostel life have taught me to cope and adjust with other people.”
Possible Answer #2:

“In a team, there are times when I and some of my peers work hard to achieve a goal, while there are some people who leave their modules incomplete or quit mid-way. At such a juncture, this load also gets assigned to us, the hardworking lot. I don’t mind helping my peers out, but when an extra load of work gets assigned to me in the 11th hour, I get irritated. Sometimes, when I know that I cannot do justice to this new module, I politely refuse to take it up.”

##### Are you open to take risks? or Do you like experimenting?

Possible Answer #1:

“It is always good to venture into new waters and new technologies. I am a very adaptive person and my diligence helps me pick up new stuff quickly. Experimenting or taking risks can yield both good and bad results, but the exercise in itself is a great learning experience. Such experiences generate experts and I want to become an SME or a JAVA subject matter expert someday.”
Possible Answer #2:

“This is a good question and a complex one. My answer would be both a No and a Yes. Personally, I like to experiment with new things, but I keep all my past mistakes in mind before taking a shot at a brand-new project. For example, carpentry is my hobby and I love to build small furniture pieces with my new toolkit, which was a gift from my brother. But I will never venture into a complete home renovation project with that little kit! What I mean to say is that baby steps are fine, but I will not jump off a cliff at once.”

##### What are your future goals? Tell me about your short term and long-term goals.

Possible Answer #1:

“My short-term goal is to join a reputed company, like yours, where my job role would allow me to apply my knowledge and key strengths. I want to get recognized for my contribution to the company in the long-run.”
Possible Answer #2:

“I’ve picked up Marketing Automation basics during my first job, which lasted for two years. Now I am prepared to take up a bigger and more challenging project. I want to see myself as a marketing analyst in the next two years, that would be my short-term goal. Following which, I would see myself as an end-to-end Digital Marketing Strategist or a Manager in the long run.”

##### What motivates you?

Possible Answer #1:

“I love public speaking. Preparing a presentation and talking about it in front of an audience, and then getting back to them with answers in the question and answer round, motivates me! The whole experience is so thrilling. As a Sales Rep, I think building a connection with my audience is useful, inspiring and exciting.”
Possible Answer #2:

“Meeting the set target within an assigned deadline motivates me the most. When I do so, I get a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. When this is coupled with an award, I feel all the more motivated. All in all, I like to achieve milestones, so that I can look back at them and say to myself, ‘Yes, that was my achievement.’ Visible results also motivate me.”

##### What are your hobbies? or What are you passionate about?

You can talk about your own passion here. This is a commonly asked question in all ‘HR interview questions and answers’ lists.

Possible Answer #1:

“I am passionate about painting. I have been a painter all along, ever since my childhood. Even today, I take advanced art classes during the weekends. The whole exercise of beautifying a blank canvas with colors relaxes me. It is my way of unwinding.”
Possible Answer #2:

“I’m passionate about cooking. I love to stir up a new dish or experiment with a new recipe every now and then. Every weekend, my friends come over to my place to try out a new dish. I maintain a journal where I jot down all my kitchen quests. I might publish it as a guide for home cooks, but that will have to wait until I develop and write down at least a 1000 final recipes.”

##### What are your biggest achievements till date?

Possible Answer #1:

“Becoming the Champion with 4 first prizes at the 25th Zonal Sports Meet is my biggest achievement till date.”
Possible Answer #2:

“Till date, I have accomplished several goals and milestones in my career as an app developer. The one that rings a bell is the latest version update on a core product of my current organization for customer profiling and payments. We had been slogging on this version update for 12 months at a stretch and I was a core team member. My team made me their team lead during the last 6 months and at that time, we were working on the mobile components of the product. To meet the deadline, I brought in 5 more resources, who had expertise in certain technologies, which were crucial for the pending modules. After the deployment of each of the component, all of us cross-trained to support all the platforms proficiently. In the end, we were able to deliver the project within time and budget constraints. Our CEO was highly impressed and all of us were also awarded at the quarterly town hall in December. Would you like to take a look at the Android version of our product?”

##### What are you most proud of?

Possible Answer #1:

“It is yet to come. The day I land my first job in a reputed company such as yours, will be my proudest achievement. That moment is still pending.”
Possible Answer #2:

“I am very proud of how I helped ABC company set up successful sales funnel by satisfying 60,000 hyper-responsive customers. I even won a ‘Best Performer’ award and 100% incentive payout for the same.”

Possible Answer #2:

“Last year, we wanted to improve sales by 50% but achieved just 35% which was a huge letdown, even if there was a huge boost to our ROI. The underlying issue was that I was on a holiday and my entire team took this last big deal for granted. They are all star performers, but I don’t know why they took this sure shot deal so lightly. We had built a great rapport with this client over a period of 3 months and the deal had almost been wrapped up. That was a huge failure in the recent past for me. Eventually, the deal slipped out of our hands and impacted the overall sales percentage.”

In case this strategy conflicts with your personal theories and beliefs, you can frame your answer, as shown below.

The true excitement overtook me when I got this interview call. It will be really nice if I get to work in an organization, which follows the same philosophies as I personally do. Because my technical skills will be recognized in other places as well, but personal philosophies are equally important.”
Possible Answer #2:

“Teamwork is what I truly believe in. When I saw that there was an opening in your organization, I made sure that my application was put in. Being a team-player, I believe working together to achieve a higher goal is what drives success in the long run.
